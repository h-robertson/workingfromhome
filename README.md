# Working from home: How do remote & non-remote workers spend their day?

An assignment for my Data Visualisation module on MSc Computational & Data Journalism.

### Data
The data comes from the [2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) microdata](https://www.bls.gov/tus/howto.htm) files.
(See Python notebook for data analysis).

### Visualisations
Inspired by Nathan Yau's visualisations of the ATUS, including [Counting the Hours](https://flowingdata.com/2015/11/10/counting-the-hours/), [A Day in the Life: Work and Home](https://flowingdata.com/2017/05/17/american-workday/), and [Remote vs. Non-Remote Workers](https://flowingdata.com/2018/06/06/working-remotely-and-where-the-time-goes/).

D3 graph gallery tutorials used include:
* [Density plot with several groups in d3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/density_double.html)
* [Density plot with dropdown button in d3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/density_filter.html)
* [Percent stacked barplot in d3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/barplot_stacked_percent.html)
