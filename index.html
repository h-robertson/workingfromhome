    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h1>A Day in the Life: Remote & Non-Remote Workers</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="storyText">The coronavirus lockdown has forced those who can to work remotely. But how does the
        day-to-day life of a remote worker
        differ from someone who works in their workplace?</p>
    <p class="storyText">The first chart below shows the distribution of time spent in a day doing various activities
        for remote
        and non-remote workers.</p>

    <!-- VISUALISATION 1: DENSITY PLOTS -->
    <div class="container">
        <div id="densityChart">
            <h2>How many minutes a day are spent... <select class="selectButton" id="densitySelect"

            A remote worker is defined here as someone who only works away from the workplace, and a non-remote worker
            is someone who only works at their workplace.

            <b>Most non-remote workers spend a routine 6 - 10 hours of their day working, while the schedules of
                remote
                workers are far more variable.</b>

    <!-- VISUALISATION 2: STACKED BAR-->
    <p class="storyText">The growth of remote working has different implications depending on gender. In 2019, a study
        from
        University College London found that less than 7% of couples share housework equally, with women undertaking the
        bulk of domestic duties. With remote working increasing, this imbalance could be improved, as flexible working
        patterns and no commuting frees up time for household tasks. Remote working is
        also providing mothers with opportunities to continue working, where previously having children may have
        put a halt on their careers.</p>
    <p class='storyText'>But, despite this optimistic outlook, the chart below highlights the differences we still see
        between remote and
        non-remote workers of different genders. Female remote workers aged 18-34 who have children spend an average of
        three hours on children a day, almost an hour
        and a half longer than their non-remote counterparts. This daily schedule also only takes account of activites
        directly
        reported as caring for children, and does not include other tasks throughout the day that
        are undertaken while also looking after children. On average, young male remote and non-remote male workers
        spend less than an hour caring for children.
